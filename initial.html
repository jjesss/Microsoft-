        hi jess 1
        
        change!

        this is the main

        screen readers
        commonly used clients for those with vision impairments.
        eg read a page from top to bottom audibly

        - On windows 'Narrator' is included by default but you can also install
        'JAWS' and 'NVDA'. On macOS and iOS, VoiceOver is installed by default

        Zoom : Windows in built 'Magnifier', 'ZoomText' (third party with more features)


        Contrast Checkers
        - test a web sites color usage with browser extention such as WCAGs color Checker

        Lighthouse Tool
        - important to get a first view of the accessibility (as well as other analysis) of a web sites
        - 100% score helpful as baseline but dont rely exclusively on LH

        Accessibility
        
        Color Safe Palettes

        Use correct HTML
        - <span> can be used to create a <button> and <b> can become a hyperlink
            While this may be easier to style it conveys nothing to screen readers
            - Use <a> for hyperlink 
        Semantic HTML 

                
        Descriptive Heading Hierarchy
        Good Vidual Clues

        Hyperlinks:
        Screen readers can read hyper links, so dont use 'Click here' or the URL 
        instead link it to words that the link describes more about eg. little penguin, so its clear what someone will learn about if they click the link
